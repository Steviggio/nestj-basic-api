# Side elements to include inside the project

To take advantage of this API, here are the NestJS side quests meant to give more experience with specific tools : 

  - [ ] Use swagger with Nest.js to describe the architecture of the CRUD requests ([NestJS/swagger](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction))
  - [ ] Use TypeORM/MySQL on a side repo ([TypeORM/SQL](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/sql-typeorm))
  - [ ] Use sequelize with MySQL on a side repo ([Sequelize](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/sql-sequelize)) 
  - [ ] Use the CQRS architecture on a side repo ([CQRS](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/cqrs))
  - [ ] Use Passport as the auth system ([Passport](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/passport))
  - [ ] Use GraphQL on a side repo ([GraphQL](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start))
